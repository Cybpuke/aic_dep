Got you. Here’s the simplest step-by-step to “connect your GitHub account” on this RHEL server so that git clone works directly (no surprises).

Step 1 — Make sure git is installed
git --version || sudo yum -y install git

Step 2 — Clear any wrong saved credentials (important)

If you previously tried with bad username/token, Git might be reusing it silently.

git config --global --unset credential.helper 2>/dev/null || true
rm -f ~/.git-credentials

Step 3 — Set git to remember your login (so clone works “directly” later)

Pick ONE of these:

Option A (recommended): cache in memory (no file on disk)
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=28800'


(8 hours)

Option B: store on disk (most “direct”, but less secure)
git config --global credential.helper store

Step 4 — Verify your PAT works (connectivity + account)

This confirms your token is valid before cloning.

read -s -p "GitHub PAT (classic): " TOKEN; echo
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user | head
unset TOKEN


✅ If you see JSON with "login": "..." → your account auth is working.

If you see Bad credentials → token is wrong/expired (generate a new PAT classic).

Step 5 — Verify you can access THAT repo with your PAT
read -s -p "GitHub PAT (classic): " TOKEN; echo
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/teknozor/aiCompliance
unset TOKEN


200 ✅ you have access

404 ❌ you don’t have permission to that repo (private or restricted)

403 ❌ token lacks scope/policy (needs repo scope for private repos)

Step 6 — Clone (and “connect” by entering username + PAT once)

Now do the clone normally:

git clone https://github.com/teknozor/aiCompliance.git


When it asks:

Username: your GitHub username (exactly)

Password: paste your PAT (not GitHub password)

If you set credential helper in Step 3, next time it will just work.

If you want “no prompt ever” (still safe-ish)

Use GitHub CLI (gh) to login once, then clone. (Optional)

sudo yum -y install gh 2>/dev/null || true
gh auth login -p https -h github.com
gh repo clone teknozor/aiCompliance
